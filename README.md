# DNA-Nucleotide-Translation-to-Proteins
Steps of the project

1. Manually downloaded the DNA and protein sequence data from the NCBI website.

2. Imported the DNA data into Python.

3. Created an algorithm that translated the DNA using a dictionary.
   Checked that the DNA translation

4. Matched the downloaded amino acid sequence, the protein

Brief details of DNA, Amino acids, Proteins:-

Life depends on the ability of cells to store, retrieve, and translate
genetic instructions.
These instructions are needed to make and maintain living organisms.
For a long time, it was not clear what molecules
were able to copy and transmit genetic information.
We now know that this information is carried by the dioxyribonucleic acid
